 This is a revolutionary trend and has become a super-hot topic in recent times in the ML world. It is a category of ML algorithms that use artificial neural networks (ANNs) with multiple hidden layers of neurons to address problems. Superior results are obtained by applying deep learning to several real-world problems. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs) autoencoders (AEs), generative adversarial networks (GANs), and deep belief networks (DBNs) are some of the popular deep learning methods.
